To make an STDCALL version of SQLCipher and solve the problem of missing
explicit calling convention in OpenSSL headers, this setup uses a proxy
crypto_openssl_p.c/h. This way, the OpenSSL header files do not need to
be patched. However, this approach a fairly laborious. Labeling 24 called
OpenSSL functions with explicit __cdecl is a much simpler approach.

N.B.: crypto_openssl_p.c/h are actually incomplete. 9 routines or so are
missing (if build process is exectuted, their names will be in stdout.log
at the end of the file following the error message:
sqlite3.lo : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol).
